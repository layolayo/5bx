# 🧬 The Bio-Calibration Protocol

> **Tune Your Engine. Master Your Metrics.**

The 5BX isn't just about counting reps—it's about understanding your body's hidden signals. To give you accurate "Bio-Adaptive" feedback, the system needs to know your baseline. That's where the **Calibration Wizard** comes in.

## 🎯 The Mission

We need to map your heart's performance across the full spectrum of intensity. Think of this as a "Dyno Test" for your cardiovascular system.

**Run this every 30 Days** to keep your profile accurate as you get fitter!

## ⚡ The 4 Phases

The Wizard will guide you through four distinct 60-second phases. Here is your cheat sheet for acing them:

### Phase 1: 🧘 REST (Baseline)
*   **Goal**: Find your absolute calm.
*   **Action**: Sit comfortably. hands on knees. Close your eyes. Breathe slowly and deeply (4 seconds in, 6 seconds out).
*   **Why**: This sets your "Zero Point". We measure your resting HRV (Heart Rate Variability) here. High HRV = Ready to train!

### Phase 2: 🧠 STRESS (Cognitive Load)
*   **Goal**: Simulate mental focus and visual processing load.
*   **Action**: A **Necker Cube** (wireframe box) will appear. Focus intently on the front side of the cube. Try to mentally "hold" the orientation of the cube in that position, either down-left or up-right.
*   **Why**: We want to see how your heart reacts to *mental* engagement and visual concentration vs *physical* stress.

### Phase 3: 🔥 EXERTION (The Spike)
*   **Goal**: Maximize Heart Rate quickly.
*   **Action**: **GO!** Do Jumping Jacks, High Knees, or Burpees. Go hard. We need to drive your Heart Rate up.
*   **Why**: This measures your "Throttle Response". How fast can your heart mobilize energy?

### Phase 4: ❄️ RECOVERY (The Cooldown)
*   **Goal**: Return to baseline.
*   **Action**: Stop moving immediately. Sit down. Return to your deep breathing.
*   **Why**: This is the most critical metric. How quickly can your system switch from "Fight or Flight" back to "Rest and Digest"? A fast recovery is the hallmark of an elite athlete.

## 📊 The Result: Your Bio-Profile

Once complete, the system calculates your unique **Bio-Profile**:

| Metric | What it means |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Baseline HRV** | Your fuel tank. Use this to determine if you should push hard or take it easy. |
| **Max HR** | Your redline. We update your age-predicted max if you exceed it. |
| **Recovery Score** | Your cooling system efficiency. |

> **Pro Tip:** Do not drink caffeine immediately before calibration, or your "Rest" scores will be skewed!
