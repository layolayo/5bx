# 5bx
Linux app to track users doing the 5BX Exercise Program - with Heart Rate Monitor functionality

Based on the Canadian Air Force exercise program.

Create a new user - then run your first session, you will be given the lowest level (Chart 1 - Level D-)
How you perform here will determine your next level

I have split Strength and Cardio so users can progress seperately in these, I need that as a 50+ year old!

Enjoy
