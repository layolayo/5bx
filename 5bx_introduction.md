# The Royal Canadian Air Force 5BX Plan

> **Five Basic Exercises. Eleven Minutes a Day. No Equipment Required.**

The **5BX (Five Basic Exercises)** plan was developed by the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) in the late 1950s. Designed by Dr. Bill Orban, it was created for men stationed in remote outposts with no gym equipment and limited space. Its genius lies in its efficiency: it provides a complete full-body workout in strictly **11 minutes**.

## The Concept

5BX is a **progressive system**. It is not a single workout, but a ladder of **6 Charts**, each containing **12 Levels**. 

*   **Total Levels**: 72
*   **Time**: 11 Minutes (Constant)
*   **Goal**: As you get fitter, you do *more* repetitions of *harder* exercises within the same 11-minute window.

### Why It Works
1.  **Balanced Fitness**: It targets flexibility, core strength, upper body strength, and cardiovascular endurance.
2.  **No Excuses**: It requires no gear—not even a mat—and takes less time than a coffee break.
3.  **Age-Graded**: Your goal isn't necessarily to reach the end (Chart 6 Level 12); it's to reach the level appropriate for your age group and maintain it.

## The 5 Exercises

Every session consists of the same 5 movements, performed in order. While the specific technique evolves as you move up the Charts (e.g., knee push-ups become clapping push-ups), the core structure remains identical.

### 1. Flexibility (2 Minutes)
Stretches for the toes, floor, and spine.

### 2. Core / Abs (1 Minute)
Movements to engage the abdominals, such as sit-ups and leg raises.

### 3. Back Extension (1 Minute)
Exercises to strengthen the lower back and improve posture.

### 4. Upper Body (1 Minute)
Push-up variations to build chest and arm strength.

### 5. Cardio (6 Minutes)
High-intensity movement to build heart and lung capacity.
*   **Stationary Run**: Running in place (lifting knees, counting steps).
*   **Outdoor Option**: Charts 1-4 allow for a Walk or Run substitute if you prefer.

## How to Follow the Plan

### 1. Find Your Starting Point
Most beginners should start at **Chart 1, Level 1**. Even if you are fit, start low to perfect your form and build the habit.

### 2. The Daily Routine
*   Perform the exercises in order (1 -> 5).
*   Stick strictly to the time limits (2m, 1m, 1m, 1m, 6m).
*   Count your repetitions.

### 3. Progressing (Leveling Up)
*   **Meet the Target**: If you complete the required reps for your level within the time limit, you "Pass".
*   **Move Up**: Passing usually allows you to move to the next Level (e.g., C1 D- -> C1 D).
*   **Hold Steady**: If you miss the target, stay at your current level. Do not move up until you can complete it properly.

### 4. Progression & Regression
*   **Leapfrog**: If you smash the targets, the app may graduate you multiple levels at once.
*   **Demotion**: If you fail to meet targets for **3 consecutive sessions**, the system will lower your level to match your performance. This ensures you are always challenged but never overwhelmed.

### 5. Maintenance
Once you reach the level assigned to your age group (e.g., Chart 3 for a 35-year-old), you can switch to a "Maintenance Schedule" (3 days a week) instead of daily training. Of course, you are free to push further if you want to achieve elite fitness!

## Visual Guide: The Charts

The program is built on **6 Charts**. Each chart represents a significant increase in difficulty. Below is **Chart 1**, which covers the beginner stages.

### How to Read the Chart
*   **Columns**: The 5 Exercises (1-5).
*   **Rows**: The 12 Levels of difficulty (D- to A+).
*   **The Numbers**: The exact number of **Repetitions** you must complete.
*   **Time Limits**:
    *   **Ex 1**: 2 Minutes
    *   **Ex 2, 3, 4**: 1 Minute each
    *   **Ex 5**: 6 Minutes
