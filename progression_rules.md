# 5BX Progression Rules

> **Your roadmap to the next level.**

This document outlines the "hidden logic" of the 5BX App. While the interface is simple, the engine under the hood is constantly evaluating your performance to ensure you are always in the optimal training zone.

## 🎯 1. The Golden Rule

The fundamental law of 5BX is simple:
> **Meet the Target = Level Up**

*   **Pass**: If you hit the target reps (or beat the target time), you qualify for promotion.
*   **Miss**: If you miss by even 1 rep, you **MAINTAIN**. You do not drop down instantly, but you cannot advance.

## 🚀 2. Going Up: Progression

When you pass a level, the system calculates *how well* you passed to decide your fate.

### A. LEVEL UP (Standard)
*   **The Vibe**: "Steady progress."
*   **Condition**: You met the targets for your current level.
*   **Result**: You move to the absolute **next level** (e.g., C1 A- ➡ C1 A).

### B. LEAPFROG (Accelerated)
*   **The Vibe**: "You're crushing it."
*   **Condition**: Your performance was essentially "too good" for your current level.
*   **Result**: You skip levels entirely (e.g., C1 A- ➡ C1 A+).
*   **Logic**: The app internally checks every level in your chart. If your reps were high enough to pass a higher level, you are instantly catapulted there.

## ⚔️ 3. Split Mode: Strength vs. Cardio

Your body is not a monolith. You might have legs of steel but the lungs of a smoker (or vice versa).
The app tracks **Strength** (Ex 1-4) and **Cardio** (Ex 5) independently.

### The Strength Verdict
*   **Exercises**: 1, 2, 3, 4.
*   **Rule**: You must pass **ALL 4** exercises to upgrade.
*   **Failure**: Miss one? You fail them all. (Verdict: **MAINTAIN**)

### The Cardio Verdict
*   **Exercise**: 5 (Stationary, Run, or Walk).
*   **Stationary**: Hit the Reps.
*   **Run/Walk**: Beat the Clock.
*   **Failure**: Too slow or too few steps? Verdict: **MAINTAIN**.

### The Result
You can level up in Strength while staying put in Cardio.
> *Example Verdict: **Strength (LEAPFROG 🚀) / Cardio (MAINTAIN 🛑)***

## 🏔️ 4. The Big Leagues: Changing Charts

Moving from one Chart to the next (e.g., Chart 1 to Chart 2) is a major milestone.

*   **The Gatekeeper**: You must reach and pass **Level 12 (A+)** of your current Chart.
*   **The Step Up**: Your next promotion sends you to **Level 1 (D-)** of the next Chart.
*   **No Skipping**: You cannot "Leapfrog" across charts. You must beat the final boss (Level 12) to unlock the next world.

## 📉 5. Setbacks & Comebacks

Sometimes, life happens. Or maybe you just got promoted too fast. The system handles failure gracefully to keep you training effectively.

### A. The "3 Strikes" Rule
*   **Condition**: Valid if you receive a **MAINTAIN** (or FAIL) verdict for **3 consecutive sessions**.
*   **The Slide**: You are automatically demoted to the level that matches your *actual* performance.
*   **The Streak**: The failure counter persists until you win. If you get demoted and fail again immediately, that counts as Strike 4 (immediate demotion again).

### B. Chart Drops (The Safety Net)
*   **Condition**: You are at the bottom of a Chart (Level 1 / D-) and you *still* can't hit the target.
*   **Result**: You are dropped to the **Previous Chart**.
*   **Soft Landing**: To prevent discouragement, you are placed at the **Top (Level 12 / A+)** of the lower chart. You strictly go down, but you land on your feet.

> *"Do not be discouraged by a setback. It is merely a sign that you have found your true training limit, and true growth begins there."*
